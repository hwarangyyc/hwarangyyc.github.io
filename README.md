# HWARANGyyc.ca source code in Jekyll

## Problem definition
  * It seems like one of the GEMs, i.e., polyglot, which supports language switcher, is not supported by GitHub.
  * This repo cannot be deployed and jekylled on-the-fly on github.com.
  * Therefore, this repo serves a code repo to generate static Web pages and they will be pushed to the main on hwarangyyc.github.io.

## To run Jekyll
<code>gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve</code>
